                My name is Samuel Rodriguez, I am 23 years old, and I live in Lower East Side Manhattan, where I was born and raised.
                I graduated from Cornell University in 2018 with a BS in Biology, and I currently work at an Educational Technology Company
                named Amplify for their Math Department. I am taking this course to further my skills in computer science so that I may use it to create technology going forward.
